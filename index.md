### Brief CV
I am working in State Key Lab of CAD&CG now, supervised by [Dr. Yubo Tao](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/ybtao/). I received my bachelor's degree in Geographic Information Science from Zhejiang University. I am interested in Scientific Visualization, Information Visualization and Machine Learning.

### Projects
#### Android based Visualization of Air Pollution

> Zhejiang University&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jun.2016-May.2017&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor: Yubo Tao

Based on web crawler, we accomplish the visualization of atmospheric pollutants. We use thermal maps, line graphs and Voronoi diagrams as multifaceted data presentation. We also use R to do further correlation analysis.  

#### CNN based High Efficiency Retrieval Method of Remote Sensing Image

> Zhejiang University&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dec.2017-Jun.2018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor: Zhenhong Du
    
We use CNN to extract features of remote sensing images. Then  we fine-tune the network structure to learn compact binary codes. Finally we combine binary codes and high-dimensional vectors for image retrieving.

#### CNNs based Viewpoint Estimation for Volume Visualization

> Zhejiang University&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dec.2017-Jun.2018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor: Yubo Tao

We first design an overfit-resistant image rendering pipeline to generate the training images
with accurate viewpoint annotations, and then train a category-specific viewpoint classification network to
estimate the viewpoint. We also introduce a CNN feature-based image similarity measure for similarity voting based viewpoint selection.
