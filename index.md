## Introduction
I am working in State Key Lab of CAD&CG now, supervised by [Dr. Yubo Tao](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/ybtao/). I received my bachelor's degree in Geographic Information Science from Zhejiang University. I am interested in Scientific Visualization, Information Visualization and Machine Learning.

## Projects
#### Shooting Game - An OpenGL-based Videogame Project
_Zhejiang Universitynbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apr.2016-Jun.2016nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor: Hongzhi Wu_
We structure gameplay in the rst person shooter genre. The user can select the class in which he or she would like to play as, and then complete a level by defeating computer-controlled players of the opposing class in the battle. The game includes several challenging computer graphics elements, including collision detection between the player and enemy characters, and several very complex objects with many thousands of polygons, and animation sequences for enemy characters.

#### Android based Visualization of Air Pollution  
_Zhejiang University&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jun.2016-May.2017&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor: Yubo Tao_  
Based on web crawler, we accomplish the visualization of atmospheric pollutants. We use thermal maps, line graphs and Voronoi diagrams as multifaceted data presentation. We also use R to do further correlation analysis.  

#### CNN based High Efficiency Retrieval Method of Remote Sensing Image  
_Zhejiang University&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dec.2017-Jun.2018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor: Zhenhong Du_  
We use CNN to extract features of remote sensing images. Then  we fine-tune the network structure to learn compact binary codes. Finally we combine binary codes and high-dimensional vectors for image retrieving.

#### CNNs based Viewpoint Estimation for Volume Visualization  
_Zhejiang University&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dec.2017-Jun.2018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor: Yubo Tao_  
We first design an overfit-resistant image rendering pipeline to generate the training images with accurate viewpoint annotations, and then train a category-specific viewpoint classification network to estimate the viewpoint. We also introduce a CNN feature-based image similarity measure for similarity voting based viewpoint selection.

## Experiences
#### Zhejiang Unversity Broadcasting and Televation Station  
_Software Engineer(Sept.2014-Jun.2017)_  
My work mainly includes system backend development. In the three years, I participate in the development of the TV station's Recruiting System, Interview System, Equipment Access System, Course System and so on.  In the third year, I lead the integration of the Workflow system as the head of the group. At the same time, I am responsible for the training of new members.

#### NineChapter Algorithm  
_Teaching Assistant(Jul.2017-)_  
NineChapter Algorithm is a company aimed at helping Chinese get better jobs in North America. I am the teaching assistant of Algorithm class and Artificial Intelligence training camp. I am responsible for communicating and answering questions for students, and reviewing the course project for each one.
